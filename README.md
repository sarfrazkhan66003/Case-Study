# Case-Study
The Death Cause Analysis project aims to explore the causes of death across different regions, age groups, or other demographic factors. Using data analytics, we examine the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and potential correlations that may provide valuable insights into public health.

#Key-Objectives:
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Remove inconsistencies, fill missing values, and transform data for better analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualizations to explore the dataset's main characteristics and patterns.
Pattern Identification: Detect notable trends, such as the most common causes of death by age, region, and over time.
Insights and Recommendations: Summarize findings to inform possible public health decisions and preventive measures.


#Why This Analysis is Important:
Understanding the factors and trends related to mortality can help health organizations and policymakers make better decisions to improve health outcomes. This project uses data to bring these insights to light, guiding future efforts for reducing preventable deaths and allocating healthcare resources more effectively.
